Raspberry Pi OS Lite with [Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng) pre installed. Also called HyperBian.
We provide two different versions (arm64/armhf) according to your preferred hardware platform.

**Recommendation:**
Use the arm64 image to benefit from a true 64 bit system.
In case you run a Raspberry Pi 1, 2 or Zero v1, go for the armhf one.

Find the [installation instruction](https://docs.hyperion-project.org/en/user/HyperBian.html#installation) at the Hyperion documentation site.
